# Ch2 - Packet Tracer Skills Integration Challenge


## Introduction:
This activity focuses on **basic device configurations** and **static routing**. The addressing scheme has already been determined. Once all devices are configured, you will:
- Test for **end-to-end connectivity**.
- Examine your configuration.

---

## Learning Objectives:
1. **Cable the devices.**
2. Apply a **basic configuration** to the devices.
3. Configure **static and default routing**.
4. **Test connectivity** and examine the configuration.

---

## Tasks

### **Task 1: Cable the devices**
- Cable the networks according to the topology.
- Ensure that interfaces match the labels shown in the activity.
- **HQ** is the **DCE** side of both WAN links.

---

### **Task 2: Apply a basic configuration**
1. Configure the routers with basic settings, including addressing.
2. For **WAN links**:
   - Assign the **first address** to **HQ**.
   - Assign the **second address** to the other router.
3. For **LANs**:
   - Assign the **first address** to the router interface.
   - Assign the **.10 address** to the PCs.
4. Use the following credentials:
   - **Line passwords**: `cisco`
   - **Secret password**: `class`
5. Set the **clock rate** to `64000`.

---

### **Task 3: Configure static and default routing**
1. **HQ** should have exactly **two static routes**.
2. **B1** and **B2** should have **one default route** each.

---

### **Task 4: Test connectivity and examine the configuration**

#### Step 1 – Test connectivity:
- Ensure **end-to-end connectivity**.
- Use the `ping` command to test across the network.
- Troubleshoot until pings are successful.

#### Step 2 – Examine the configuration:
- Use **verification commands** to ensure all configurations are complete.

---

## Completion:
- At the end of this activity, your **completion rate** should be **100%**.
- If not, use the **Check Results** button and troubleshoot as necessary.
